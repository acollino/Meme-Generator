# Meme Generator
A meme generator to create custom memes from online images! This app was created for Springboard's Unit 5 assessment.
The app utilizes form and input elements to obtain information from the user, then uses Javascript-created img and canvas elements
to display the generated meme within a flexbox container. This allows you to generate and display multiple memes at once, and users
can simply copy the generated images to be able to paste and use them elsewhere!
